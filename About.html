	<h1>Our Story</h1>

		<p>December 3, 1994: The greatest video game console ever created was released in Japan.  The Sony Playstation launched in Japan with immediate success, selling over 2 million units within six months.  Less than a year later, Playstation was available world wide and enjoying massive market adaptation.</p>
		
		<p>With numerous smash hit titles like <span class="gameTitle">Vagrant Story, Metal Gear Solid, Twisted Metal, </span>and <span class="gameTitle">Final Fantasy VII</span>, the influence and legacy of the Sony Playstation can be felt to this day.  Many would hail this system as ushering in a Golden Age in video games.</p>
		
		<p>Growing up in small town Moulton, AL, Jennie and James Moltiva spent their childhood enraptured by the unilimited possibilities offered by the PS.  No longer limited to the world around them, the siblings dove into a massive universe of fantasy, action, and science previously unknown to them.  Hours spent finding hidden treasure, vanquishing giants, and saving the world from certain doom helped shape them into confident, imaginative young adults.</p>

		<p>After the original Playstation went out of production in 2004, Jennie and James decided to open up a store dedicated to the gaming system which so heavily influenced their lives.  Now, 12 years later, they are a thriving business in the Nashville area, a hub of activity and nostalgia for classic gamers.  Please feel
